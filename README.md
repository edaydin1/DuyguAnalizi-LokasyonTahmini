💡 From YouTube Videos to Travel Plan! 🌍✈️

I developed an AI tool to make my travel planning easier! 🚀

📌 How does it work?
🔗 You paste a link to a YouTube video with subtitles.
📍 We analyze the video title and determine which city or country it belongs to.
🗺️ With the OpenStreetMap API, we detect the locations mentioned in the video and mark them on the map!

🛠 Technologies we use:
✅ Gemini - to analyze and make sense of video text
✅ OpenStreetMap API - To show locations on a map
✅ Language Integration - To correctly identify location names in different languages
✅ Parse Operation - To parse place names in text and get the most accurate results
